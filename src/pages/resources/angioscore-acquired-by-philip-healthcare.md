### IBM Cognos Business Intelligence System Tracks the Heartbeat of Sales to Deliver Real-Time Visibility for AngioScore

AngioScore Inc.develops, manufactures and markets the innovative AngioSculpt Scoring Balloon Catheter to significantly alter the landscape for treating both peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and coronary artery disease (CAD).AngioScore addresses markets that represent a worldwide opportunity of over $2 billion.

To empower a small sales team to more effectively address the massive worldwide market opportunity,AngioScore faced the challenge to provide up-to-date sales information for management and sales teams in real-time delivered for both mobile and web-based devices.

A comprehensive IBM Cognos 8 business intelligence (BI) system developed by Incede.ai provides the AngioScore sales team with easy access to intuitively designed dashboards and reports with the capability to drill-down to details.To provide a real-time view into sales,reports based on the latest orders are pushed out on a regular basis to the sales team on their mobile devices. 

*"Current and valid information for management is essential for the success of our sales organization and for efficiently marketing the AngioScore products," said Lu Lee,Director of IT,AngioScore."Sales data, order quantities and product lines must be available quickly and reliably.We knew that a BI platform was necessary to supply information for decision-making to the sales team and sales management."*

AngioScore turned to Incede.ai for its expertise in delivering BI systems based on IBM Cognos.

Incede.ai consultants gained a strong understanding of the AngioScore business model and worked rapidly and efficiently to develop the new BI system for AngioScore that provided:

* Easy analysis of daily sales information
* Product sales trends and product sales history 
* An easy-to-use facility to write simple ad hoc reports 
* Tracking of product sales initiatives

Capabilities of the BI system include automated reporting of daily sales for immediate view of business performance and a dashboard screen with drill-through access to detail behind the summary reports for improved decision-making.The system connects for real-time updates to AngioScore's Salesforce.com and Expandable ERP systems, and replaces several SAP Crystal reports with IBM Cognos.

The cost savings were a result of consolidating into one centralized, scalable infrastructure leveraging common operational services within IBM Cognos 8 BI.

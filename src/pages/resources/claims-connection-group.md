**Business challenge story**

*Navigating the claims flood*

Operating in the high-stakes world of property insurance, CCG faced mounting pressure to modernize its claims process. Manual data handling, inconsistent policy interpretation, and fragmented workflows slowed response times—especially when natural disasters such as hailstorms and heavy rains triggered a flood of property damage claims. These inefficiencies created bottlenecks across the insurance value chain, frustrating policyholders, overwhelming agents, and increasing the risk of compliance missteps.

To maintain trust and service quality during critical moments, CCG required a smarter, scalable solution that could deliver speed, accuracy, and clarity to every claim’s interaction.

**Transformation**

*Building an AI-driven platform*

CCG worked with IBM to create a fully digital claims platform powered by AI and automation. Using watsonx to interpret complex insurance language, Business Automation Workflow to coordinate collaboration, and RPA to eliminate repetitive tasks, the company unified processes in a single watsonx Orchestrate interface. The new platform not only streamlined every stage of claims handling but also improved visibility and accountability across stakeholders. 

The result: faster cycle times, fewer errors, and seamless task assignment for agents, carriers, and vendors, even during periods of extreme claim surges..

**Results story**

*From crisis to confidence*

The impact is most visible during high-stress events. Policyholders receive clarity on coverage upfront, agents resolve claims more quickly, and carriers experience fewer compliance risks. Vendors benefit from clear, timely assignments, even during claim surges. By transforming its operations, CCG has elevated the claims experience for all stakeholders—turning moments of crisis into opportunities to reinforce confidence and trust.

The company selected IBM® Watson® Discovery offerings to build an insight engine for powering a new AI platform that can deliver highly accurate, detailed insights into customer experiences. Now, it can more effectively arm businesses and governments with the specific knowledge needed for taking targeted actions to solve problems.

### Business Challenge 

To help organizations and businesses improve their customer experience, Max Kelsen sought to unlock insights hidden in unstructured data, including social media, call center logs, letters and emails.

### Business challenge story 

Max Kelsen helps companies explore the previously unexplorable—unstructured qualitative customer data—to gain unprecedented insights for driving higher ROI on customer-experience initiatives. Passionate about AI, the people who founded and grew the company recognized that traditional means of data gathering and analysis couldn’t provide the depth of detail required to identify specific problem areas.

“A lot of companies hit a roadblock on what they can improve using traditional approaches,” explains Nicholas Therkelsen-Terry, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Cofounder of Max Kelsen. “Many come to us and say, ‘We’ve done focus groups and surveys, but we’re not sure where to go from here to get better outcomes.’ Max Kelsen comes in and helps diagnose the problem.

“We look across their omnichannel world to understand where and when customers are being let down by the experience with that brand and identify exactly why it’s happening, when it’s happening and to whom,” he continues. “Then, they can put in highly targeted programs to improve the customer experience and move the metrics up.”

Max Kelsen refers to unstructured customer-experience data as “dark data,” because it lies dormant in call center complaint logs, online surveys, and verbatim comments made in emails and letters and on social media. This untapped resource can reveal a fuller, more precise picture of the customer experience by providing invaluable insights into qualitative, individualized dimensions of relationships, including emotion and sentiment.

Typically, governments and businesses gauge customer satisfaction by analyzing structured data, including demographic and transaction information gathered from CRM and other systems, product ratings and loyalty metrics. Yet aggregated, quantitative measurements extrapolated from this type of data generally provide an incomplete picture. They fail to accurately decipher the customer’s, or citizen’s, voice at each stage of the journey, making it hard to precisely identify the issues that need addressing. As a result, organizations can neither invest wisely nor take the proper steps to repair and strengthen relationships.

For example, many call centers use customer satisfaction surveys to help generate Net Promoter Score (NPS) loyalty metrics. A person might rate his or her overall call center experience as a 5 on a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), because the representative adequately addressed the core issue. However, that person’s written comments might indicate that the representative was unfriendly, feedback that remains unheard.

Therkelsen-Terry explains that many large organizations already have huge volumes of unstructured data potentially full of business value but unexaminable without cognitive tools. They often spend millions of dollars engaging outside market research firms to help them collect and analyze new qualitative data. But despite the investment, these organizations still can’t tap in to the nuanced, individualized aspects of their customers’ experiences.

Max Kelsen seeks to offer a more cost-efficient, exact approach by using AI technologies to help organizations take advantage of the qualitative data underlying their more typically analyzed quantitative data. The company began by analyzing Twitter and other public social media data. However, as the business expanded, Max Kelsen started looking at ways to intelligently search unstructured private data, regardless of source, format or length, to reveal the nuance and context of myriad customer interactions.

At one point, a local market research firm approached Max Kelsen on behalf of one of its customers, a government entity in Australia, seeking detailed insights into issues affecting the safety and satisfaction of millions of its urban residents. Citizen feedback collected through surveys and other traditional means, for example, revealed high levels of anger and frustration concerning cycling. Government leaders set aside funds to build more bike lanes in popular cycling spots; however, too many questions regarding the nature of the problem remained unanswered. Exactly who was upset and why? Were cyclists frustrated with a lack of infrastructure, or were drivers angry about sharing city streets? Or were other groups and factors at play? Before they could confidently invest taxpayer funds to develop more infrastructure, officials sought clear, accurate answers to help guide their decisions.

To deliver the deeper insights the government and other enterprises requested, Max Kelsen accelerated development of its intelligent platform. It needed advanced AI tools, including natural language processing (NLP) technologies for uncovering emotions, sentiments and relationships. Given the young organization’s limited resources, it also sought to quickly and efficiently build and train customized machine learning models.
